Hi, I'm Jason!

I am a current 4th year student at Georgia Tech, pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with concentrations in Intelligence and Theory along with a minor in Economics. Two fields that specifically interest me are Machine Learning and its applications, along with Quantitative Finance.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing chess, a game I grew up playing competetively, along with poker, and tennis.
