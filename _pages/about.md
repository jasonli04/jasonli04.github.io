Hi, I'm Jason!

I am a current 4th year student at Georgia Tech, pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with concentrations in Intelligence and Theory along with a minor in Economics. Some fields that specifically interest me are Machine Learning and its applications, Quantitative Finance, and building scalable systems. Through internships, I have been able to gain experience and hone my skillset by building NLP models, cloud infrastructure, and data platforms that support real-world applications.

Post graduation, I’ll be joining Old Mission Capital as a Junior Quantitative Trader, where I'm excited to tackle problems at the intersection of markets and technology.

Outside of the classroom, I enjoy playing chess, a game I grew up playing competetively, and led the Georgia Tech Chess Club as president from 2023-2025. Additionally, I enjoy playing poker and sports such as tennis and basketball.
